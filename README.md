#bluetoothregsys

## Inspiration
Students no matter who they are enjoy ease of use. With this system, registration becomes much easier and less time consuming.

## What it does
Allows students to sign into lectures, seminars and tutorials just by enabling Bluetooth at the beginning.

## How we built it
We used a Raspberry Pi and Bluetooth API to detect bluetooth devices that once linked to a student, can be used to sign into lectures, seminars and tutorials without doing more than enabling bluetooth

## Challenges we ran into
We originally intended on using Java however as the current Raspberry Pi 3 does not support javac this halted this method and forced us into using Python; a language which none of us have much experience with

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We managed to produce something which we honestly believe will make a difference. More than a simple in and out system.

## What we learned
Over the course of the hackathon it feels like we have all learned another language; Python

## What's next for Bluetooth Registration System  
We hope to get the university involved so that they can implement this into everyday life at uni making student life a little bit easier and a little bit less wasteful with paper
